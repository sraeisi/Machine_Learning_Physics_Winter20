Requirements:
=============

-   Decent understanding of programming and python and the following
    libraries

    -   Numpy

    -   Pandas

    -   Plotting and graphical presentation tools in python

-   Git and Github (if you not familiar, let me know.)

-   Basic understanding of quantum mechanics and statistics.

-   Basic understanding of machine learning


---
Marking Scheme
==============

This is a tentative plan and we may change it as we move on.

-   Course Project: 40%

-   Assignments: 30%

-   In-class exercises 10%

-   Final exam (set for Thursday, June 20th, 9AM): 30% 

These add up to 110% which include the bonus as well.


---
Course Projects
===============

This is a group project and counts towards 40% of the final grade.

The idea is that each group decides on a project at the beginning of the course
and apply everything that we cover to their project. Here are some of the
expectations for the course project:

-   Some initial proposal: Clear statement of the problem and some primary
    assessment of why using ML could help answer this problem. (Due Feb 28th)

-   Data collection/generation and preparation: (Due March 15th => <span style="color:red">Extended to March 20th</span> )
    - Create a folder for this part
    - Have a description (readme file) for the data
    - Describe your data: Where it comes from, different feautres and their physical significance, your target value(s)
    - Create a notebook and implement the following in different sections:
        - Clean up the data (remove the missing data and convert everything to numerical values)
        - Scale your data
        - Analysis of features and target (Histograms and )
        - Feature selection (Try different techniques and assess how well they work on your data)
        - Feature extraction (Try different techniques and assess how well they work on your data)

-   Application of the basic ML techniques: (Due April 15th)

    -   A table of assessment (Will give an example later.)

    -   Investigation of variance and bias of the techniques investigated.

    -   Learning and validation curves

-    Application of NN and setting the hyperparameters (Due April 30th)

-   Oral presentation (See me to set up the time, it should be before **June 24th**.)

-   Written term paper (It should be submitted by **July 5th**.)

__Some notes:__
- Make sure you include citations to all the resources you use!
- You should submit your work as a group rather than separate individual submissions.
- Scripts, notebooks and figures without description would not count toward your grade.
- Your codes should include enough comments and information that can be easily followed.
- It is essential that all group members contribute (make commits) to their repositories, this is the only way I can make sure that everyone participated in their project.
